## Waste point definitions

LOC:
  name: Location
  description: For location history of portable bins in RTLS system
  haystack:         
    type:
      - location
      - point
      - sensor
    identification:
      - kind: Number
      - dis: <LEVEL> + - + <ROOM>
      - id: machine generated
    reference:
      - equipRef
WASWT:
  name: Waste Weight
  description: Weight of bin contents. For weighing stations or bin-mounted load cells
  metadata:         ## Not really described by Haystack.
    type:
      - waste
      - weight
      - point
    identification:
      - kind: Number
    reference:
      - equipRef
WASFL:
  name: Waste Level
  description: Volumetric fill level, typically via ultrasonic distance measurement
  metadata:         ## Not really described by Haystack. `quantity. Volume marker` type broadly describes the concept but is not a point
    type:
      - waste
      - level
      - sensor
      - point
    identification:
      - kind: Number
      - unit: Percentage
    reference:
      - equipRef
WASCR:              ## Check for clashes
  name: Waste Contamination Rate
  description: Contamination rate by weight 
  metadata:         ## Not really described by Haystack.
    type:
      - waste
      - contamination
      - point
    identification:
      - kind: Number
      - unit: Percentage
    reference:
      - equipRef
PWBST:              ## Check for clashes
  name: Bin fill state
  description: Enumerated point to describe the state of the bin. Primary intent is to manage bins that may not ben in service and therefore may attract differing behaviour from analytics (e.g. 'clean', 'filling', 'full', 'dirty')
  metadata:         ## Not really described by Haystack.
    type:
      - bin
      - sensor
      - state
      - point
    identification:
      - kind: Enum
    reference:
