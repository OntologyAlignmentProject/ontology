# KPI Definition Structure
#
# KPICODE:
#   name: <common name or title for the KPI>
#   short_name: <optional shorter name that can contain common abbreviations or acronyms>
#   description: <a description of the KPI>
#   is_base: <boolean designation that this KPI is extended by others, default is "false">
#   extends: <code of the KPI that this KPI is extending>
#   inputs: <list of other KPIs that input into the calculation of this KPI>
#   range: <list of allowable range types (from field.calculation.yaml)>
#   rollup_interval: <list of allowed rollup intervals (from field.calculation.yaml)>
#   rollup_calculation: <list of possible calculation types (from field.calculation.yaml)>
#   normalization: <list of possible data normalizations (from field.calculation.yaml)>
#   comparison: <list of the comparison methods typical used for the KPI (from field.calculation.yaml)>
#   unit_type: <a single unit type from (units.yaml)>
#   units: <list of possible units of measure (from units.yaml)>
#   class: cateogry or grouping of KPI, KPI can belong to more than one category such as energy and cost
# Usage Rules:
#  - range=date means a start and end date needs to be provided to get a historty
#  - rollup_interval is a single select only
#  - rollup_interval=range means that a single value is returned for the entire range specified
#  - rollup_calculation is single select only
#  - normalization can be multi select

# How to apply KPI to entity, e.g.:
# SITE:
#   kpi:
#     - TEEC
#     - TNGEC
#     - PKED
